                    <p className="text-justify text-white text-shadow">Tito Brito was born 27 November 2003 in Brazil. Tito is an electronic musician based in Salvador, Brazil.</p>
                    <p className="text-justify text-white text-shadow">Synthesized and recorded entirely on their computer, Brito's work can mainly be described as emotive, idiosyncratic and heartfelt. For the moment, it can only be found on their <a href="https://www.soundcloud.com/arpejo" target="_blank" className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-900 font-extrabold underline underline-offset-1">SoundCloud</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tito_apiari" target="_blank" className="text-red-600 hover:text-red-900 font-extrabold underline underline-offset-1">YouTube</a> accounts.</p>
                    <p className="text-justify text-white text-shadow">Music has always been a significant part of Brito's life. They began making music in the autumn of 2020, during a harsh period of isolation and emotional distress, as a means of self-expression. They kept making music in secret until the spring of 2023, when they were finally confident enough to share it with their loved ones.</p>
                    <p className="text-justify text-white text-shadow">Brito plans to release their first EP sometime in 2025.</p>
